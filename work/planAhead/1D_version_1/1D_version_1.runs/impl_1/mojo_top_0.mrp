  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   6

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:866 - Not enough valid sites to place the following IOBs:
   IO Standard: Name = LVCMOS25, VREF = NR, VCCO = 2.50, TERM = NONE, DIR =
   INPUT, DRIVE_STR = NR
   	level_reset[0]

   This may be due to either an insufficient number of sites available on the
   device, too many prohibited sites,
   or incompatible I/O Standards locked or range constrained to I/O Banks with
   valid sites.
       This situation could possibly be resolved by one (or all) of the
   following actions:
   a) Grouping IOBs of similar standards into a minimum amount of I/O Banks by
   using LOC or range constraints.
   b) Maximizing available I/O Banks resources for special IOBs by choosing
   lower capacity I/O Banks if possible.
   c) If applicable, decreasing the number of user prohibited sites or using a
   larger device.
ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Map:284 - Map is running with the multi-threading option on. Map currently
   supports the use of up to 2 processors. Based on the the user options and
   machine load, Map will use 2 processors during this run.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 62 IOs, 59 are locked
   and 3 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1.
