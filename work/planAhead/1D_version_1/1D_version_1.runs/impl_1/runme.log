Phase 1.1  Initial Placement Analysis (Checksum:6a1810fd) REAL time: 3 secs 

Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
INFO:Place:834 - Only a subset of IOs are locked. Out of 62 IOs, 59 are locked
   and 3 are not locked. If you would like to print the names of these IOs,
   please set the environment variable XIL_PAR_DESIGN_CHECK_VERBOSE to 1. 

ERROR:Place:866 - Not enough valid sites to place the following IOBs:
   IO Standard: Name = LVCMOS25, VREF = NR, VCCO = 2.50, TERM = NONE, DIR =
   INPUT, DRIVE_STR = NR
   	level_reset[0]

   This may be due to either an insufficient number of sites available on the
   device, too many prohibited sites,
   or incompatible I/O Standards locked or range constrained to I/O Banks with
   valid sites.
       This situation could possibly be resolved by one (or all) of the
   following actions:
   a) Grouping IOBs of similar standards into a minimum amount of I/O Banks by
   using LOC or range constraints.
   b) Maximizing available I/O Banks resources for special IOBs by choosing
   lower capacity I/O Banks if possible.
   c) If applicable, decreasing the number of user prohibited sites or using a
   larger device.
